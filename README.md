The use of software-defined networks leveraged the adoption of telemetry techniques for fine-grained monitoring. However, its indiscriminate adoption generates additional costs. It may degrade network performance, increasing the amount of the stored data to be processed, making its benefits unfeasible. The adoption of adaptive telemetry then emerges as a way to circumvent this problem. Thus, this work proposes a deep reinforcement learning engine to provide a data plane adaptive telemetry that monitors congestion. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an environment on a version of the ONOS platform enabled with the In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) engine and bmv2 software switches programmed in P4. Experiments with varying traffic profiles and hyperparameters confirm the proposal's benefits and explore its limitations.
