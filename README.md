# SmartMon
SmartMon is a framework based on a deep reinforcement learning engine to provide a data plane adaptive telemetry to monitor network congestions, reducing resource consumption of the monitoring process. The environment uses the ONOS platform enabled with the In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) engine and bmv2 software switches programmed in P4.
